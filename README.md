# Accounts and transactions simulation project
It is my final project for KaspiLab's (Kaspi Bank) course. Some comments and content is in russian just because the course itself was in russian 
As a customer you can create multiple accounts with different currency using local running host, then top up your account balance and transfer money to another customer's account with the same currency. There is also a button in each account's page that allows to build a graph of transactions which shows the history of account's balance. It uses postgreSQL database
