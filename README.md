# Accounts and transactions simulation project
It is my final project for KaspiLab's (Kaspi Bank) course. Some comments and content is in russian just because the course itself was in russian.
You can create multiple accounts with different currencies, add funds to an account balance and transfer money to another customer's account using same currency.
There is a button in each account's page that allows to build a graph of transactions which shows the history of account's balance. The project uses postgreSQL database
